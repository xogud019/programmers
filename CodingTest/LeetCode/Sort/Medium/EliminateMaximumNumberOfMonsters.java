/*
You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in meters of the ith monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in meters per minute.

The monsters start moving at minute 0. You have a weapon that you can choose to use at the start of every minute, including minute 0. You cannot use the weapon in the middle of a minute. The weapon can eliminate any monster that is still alive. You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city exactly at the start of a minute, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon in that minute.

Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.

 

Example 1:

Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3], you don't do anything.
At the start of minute 2, the distances of the monsters are [X,1,2], you eliminate the second monster.
At the start of minute 3, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,1], you eliminate the third monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
Example 2:

Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
Example 3:

Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
 

Constraints:

n == dist.length == speed.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105
